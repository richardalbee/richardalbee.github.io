Richard Albee Portfolio

This repo hosts Richard Albee's portfolio website. The website is compiled and copied to this repo from https://github.com/richardalbee/home. When a new build is detected in the home/ folder, the files are copied to this repo. This repo automatically rebuilds the website upon commit. This repo is used for production purposes while development is done on the other repo.
